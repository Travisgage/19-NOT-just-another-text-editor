## Description
A Progressive Web Application text editor that can be used online or offline to write code or take notes.  This application uses redundant methods to keep you productive regardless of circumstance: local storage AND and indexDB database.  Built using a variety of webpack plugins:

* **HtmlWebpackPlugin** to automatically generate an HTML file to be included in the bundled assets

* **MiniCssExtractPlugin** to extract CSS files and bundle seperately. 

* **InjectManifest** to inject a custom service worker to handle caching and retrieving cached data.

* **WebpackPwaManifest** to generate a manifest.json file
